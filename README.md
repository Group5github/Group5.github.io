# Traffic in Ontario

Ensuring that people and goods are moved safely across Ontario is one of the major objectives of Ontarioâ€™s Ministry of Transportation (MTO). 

We examine a dataset, collected in 2006, containing information on traffic volumes of commercial and private vehicles at different survey stations in Ontario. 

The dataset has one week of average hourly truck and auto volumes data for every hour in a week for the year 2006. 

Our Quest,

* Examine the data set and infer insights about vehicular movement in the province. 
* Identify high Ontario traffic volume at certain peak hours of the day and in certain locations 
* Develop time-series plots of vehicle movement for the week 
* Establish relationships between time and traffic volume. 
* Identify hours of the day when commuters may escape traffic around some of the busiest areas in Ontario.

## Dataset Description

The data set is found at this [link](https://files.ontario.ca/opendata/2006_commercial_vehicle_survey_-_traffic_volumes_at_survey_stations.csv).

   | Field       | Field Description 
| ------------- |-------------|
| `Station ID`      |Unique CVS station number, representing the station from which the data was collected. It takes the form ONXXXX where XXXX is a 4-digit number. There are 104 unique station IDs present in the data set |
| `Station Name`     | Station name; each Station ID carries a station name      |
| `Direction` | This includes four different traffic directions; east, west, north and south.     |
| `MTO Region` | Five regions of MTO (Central, Eastern, Southwestern, Northern, Northwestern)      |
| `Highway or Road` | Highway number or road name. There are 33 unique highways in the data set      |
| `Location` | Description of location     |
| `Day of Week Number` | A number between 1 and 7 representing day of week. 1=Sunday, 7= Saturday      |
| `Hour` | Hour of day, 0 to 23 represents starting hour of the day (e.g. 12 represents 12 P.M. - 1 P.M.)      |
| `Single` | Number of single unit trucks      |
| `Multi` | Number of multi-unit trucks     |
| `Auto` | Number of cars and other passenger vehicles      |
| `Total Trucks` | Sum of single and multi-unit vehicles      |
| `Total Vehicles` | Number of total vehicles      |


## Data Analysis

Below is a description of the data

> The data does not seem to have any null values

```python
data.describe()
```
![image of data describe](./images/data.describe.png)

Below is a sample from the dataset,

```python
data.head()
```

![image of sample data](./images/data.sample.png)

The data under analysis is for a week timeframe in 2006 and has information on following data points,

* 33 highways
* 104 highway stations 
* 5 MTORegions

#### Data Skewness analysis (and logarithm scale to the rescue)

A simple facet grid shows the data skew,

```python
g = sns.FacetGrid(vehicles, col="variable", col_wrap= 2, sharey=False, sharex=False, height=10, aspect=2)
```
![image of data skew](./images/data.skew.png)

... a logarithmic transformation yields below,
```python
np.log(data1[['single','multi','auto','totalTrucks','totalVehicles']] + 1)
```

![image of data log](./images/data.logarithm.png)

Few insights we gain from this initial take on the data, 
* The distribution of totalVehicles parallels the distribution of auto suggesting that totalVehicles composition is made up more of auto than of any of the other vehicle types. 
* This could mean that there are more autos and passenger vehicles in the province than there are trucks. 
* The totalTrucks histogram shares more similarity with multi than it does with single. This could mean there are more multi trucks in the dataset, and possibly in Ontario, than there are single trucks.

#### Outlier identification
Box plots reveal the outliers in this dataset, however we are not ignoring them as they are valid data.
```python
for item in ['single', 'multi', 'auto', 'totalTrucks']:
    sns.boxplot(y=data[item], ax=ax[i,0])
    sns.boxplot(y=data[item][data[item]<=upper_fence(data[item])-5], ax=ax[i,1])
    i += 1
```
![image of data boxplot](./images/data.boxplot.png)

# Analysis

We proceed now to analyse the data based on each of the dimensions below,

* Stations
* Highways
* Directions
* Regions
* Day and Time of day

## Stations

### Station with large volume of data

```python
ax = stationsTraffic[:40]['trafficPercentage'].plot(kind='bar', figsize=(15,6))
plt.show()
```

![image of station traffic percent](./images/stations.percentTraffic.png)

> we can establish that auto contributes the most traffic of all the kinds of vehicles for this dataset.

### Station with high auto volume

```python
ax = stationsTraffic[['single', 
                      'multi', 
                      'auto']][:10].plot(kind='bar', figsize=(15,8))
plt.show()
```
![image of station auto volume](./images/stations.vehicleCountStation.png)

> Most stations show higher auto traffic than they do of other kinds of vehicles. ON0115 and ON0116 are some of the stations with the biggest auto traffic. Station ON0033 appears to have somewhat significant truck traffic. 

### Correlations ?

```python
xcorr_values.loc[i,j] = np.corrcoef(data['totalVehicles'][data['stationID'] == i],
             data['totalVehicles'][data['stationID'] == j]
            )[0,1]
```
![image of station correlation](./images/stations.correlation.png)

> Average correlations more than 70%, it appears traffic rises pretty much at the same rate all over the province and then settles back.
For ex. ON0026 and ON0027 correlates rather highly with traffic at ON0115

### How about time series analysis on traffic data ?

```python
data[data.stationID == 'ON0021'][25:50].reset_index()[['auto']].plot(figsize=(7,5))
```
![image of station timeseries](./images/stations.timeseries.png)

> ON0021 is located on Hwy 400 between King Rd & Kettleby Rd north of Vaughan. This spike looks to be the daily northerly homeward traffic from downtown Toronto 

>A driver who cares to avoid this traffic 
>* Can take alternative route as this traffic seems a daily occurence. 
>* He might as well leave the office just as the sharp traffic peak is settling after 1500hrs.

## Highways - ON0115

```python
data[data.stationID == 'ON0115'].highway[:4]
```

>  ON0115 located on Hwy 401 is the biggest daily traffic station.

### Hwy 401 Traffic distribution

```python
ax[i//2, i%2].plot(data[['single', 
                             'multi', 
                             'auto', 
                             'totalTrucks']][(data['highway'] == 'Hwy 401') & (data['stationID'] == j)], 
                       label=j)
    ax[i//2, i%2].set_title(j, fontsize=13)
```
![image of highway station traffic](./images/highways.stationtraffic.png)

The subplots showed that station ON0115 on Hwy 401 records some of the biggest traffic. From the cross correlation matrix examined earlier, we observed that some of the other stations correlate greatly with station ON0015. Ranking these values in descending order shows that ON0026 and ON0027 are some of the other stations with traffic which correlates rather highly with traffic at ON0115. This could mean they also register sizeable traffic. We could take a look.

```python
(data.groupby('stationID')
 .mean()
 .loc[['ON0115','ON0032','ON0033', 'ON0026']]
 .iloc[:, 2:]).sort_values(by='totalVehicles', ascending=False)
```
![image of highway station ON0115](./images/highways.stationON0115.png)

> * Traffic north of ON0026 appears relatively milder. This is probably because there is a toll and as such is avoided by most drivers. The traffic is therefore much less and seems a good alternative for the traffic-conscious driver. 
> * Station ON0115 on Hwy 401 remains heavy with traffic.

### Highway with heavy traffic

Let's sort traffic by highway and arrange the results in order of decreasing mean traffic count. 

The highways with the biggest traffic in Ontario appear to be 
*Hwy 401, 
* QEW, 
* King Edward Ave, and 
* Hwy 400. 

Hwy 401 runs the length of the south of Ontario extending from its end near Detroit in the United States to the east as far as Ottawa. It apparently is also very busy because it carries traffic westwards and eastwards into Ontario's major city, Toronto.

```
highwayTraffic = (pd.pivot_table(data=data, index='highway', values=['multi', 'auto', 'single', 
                                                    'totalTrucks', 'totalVehicles'], aggfunc='mean')
.sort_values(by='auto', ascending=False))
highwayTraffic['trafficPercentage'] = highwayTraffic['totalVehicles'] * 100 / highwayTraffic['totalVehicles'].sum()
highwayTraffic.sort_values(by='trafficPercentage', ascending=False)[:10]
```

![image of highway heavyTraffic](./images/highways.heavytraffic.png)
![image of highway heavyTrafficPlot](./images/highways.heavytrafficPlot.png)

>Hwy 401, QEW and King Edward Ave account for more than 50% of vehicular traffic in the province!

### Hwy 401, the well beaten track  

* Traffic appears to begin around 5am in the morning and increases gently during the day, peaking on major highways around noon. 
* Vehicle density does not seem to reduce until towards evening around 6pm, so that by midnight it goes down significantly. 

![image of highway heavyTraffic 401](./images/highways.401.monday.png)

>The consistency in these plots suggest that the probability of getting caught in traffic trends higher as the morning arrives. 
>To beat traffic, one would have to be on the road as early as 5-6am. Leaving any sooner or later does not appear to help.

![image of highway heavyTraffic 401](./images/highways.401.friday.png)

>On the last day of the week, it appears many more cars stay on the road even towards evening (parties? night outs?), as it appears vehicle density does not reduce significantly on this day unlike on others. 

### Highway vehicle count

Again, auto make up the highest vehicle count for every highway. Apparently, it would seem there are many more small cars in the Ontario province than there are trucks. 

![image of highway vehicle count](./images/highways.vehicle.count.png)

However, are there areas in the province where trucks may dominate?

We examine again the distribution of vehicular traffic for each highway and sort by totalVehicles and totalTrucks. This time we express totalTrucks as a fraction of totalVehicles to obtain truckPercentage for each highway.

```python
highwayTraffic = (data
                  .groupby(by='highway')
                  .mean()
                  .sort_values(by=['totalVehicles', 'totalTrucks'], 
                               ascending=False)[['single','multi','auto','totalTrucks','totalVehicles']])
highwayTraffic['truckPercentage'] = highwayTraffic['totalTrucks'] * 100 / highwayTraffic['totalVehicles']
highwayTraffic.sort_values(by='truckPercentage', ascending=False)[:10]
```

![image of highway vehicle count truck](./images/highways.vehicle.count.truck.png)

> Hwy 3 - Huron Church Rd, Hwy 402, and Hwy 405 have high truck traffic. 

>These highways with huge truck traffic are located close to border toll stations in Ontario. Suggests significant commercial activity at the borders of the United States and Canada.

## Directions

### Which direction has heavy traffic ?

```python
data.pivot_table(index="direction", columns=["dayWeekNo"], values=["totalVehicles"], aggfunc="mean")
```

> The highest traffic goes towards East. 

This is in the direction of downtown Toronto from areas west of GTA (as we saw in the maps shown earlier, the stations which registered this traffic are located west of Toronto). 

This is no surprise as the central business district is located in this direction. 

>Lesser traffic comes westbound into the province, and the least traffic comes from the northern and southern directions.

This assumes heavily that most traffic heads towards the city center.

## Regions

```python
ax = data.pivot_table(index="MTORegion", columns=["dayWeekNo"], 
                      values=["totalVehicles"], aggfunc="mean").T.plot(figsize=(10,7))
```

![image of Region MTO](./images/region.traffic.png)

>For every single day of the week, the central MTO region records the highest traffic. Central contributes nearly 70% of the traffic experienced each day in the province.

## Days and Hours

```python
round((((data.groupby('dayWeekNo').mean()).iloc[:, 1:4]).T * 100/ 
 (data.groupby('dayWeekNo').mean()).iloc[:, 1:4].sum(axis=1)).T, 2).plot(kind='bar', figsize=(16,7))
```

![image of Days and Hours](./images/daysNhours.trafficpercentage.png)


> In this case the raw traffic count offers no more insight than the percentage count.

### Hours with high traffic volume

How does 11 in the morning and 4 in the evening look like ?

```python
round((((data.groupby('hour').mean()).iloc[:, 1:4]).T * 100/ 
 (data.groupby('hour').mean()).iloc[:, 1:4].sum(axis=1)).T, 2).plot(kind='bar', figsize=(16,7))
 ```

![image of Days and Hours 11AM](./images/daysNhours.11AM4PM.png)

## Machine Learning - Clustering

We attempt to scale and cluster the data set in order to gain some additional insights.

```python
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=10)
kmeans.fit(X)
y_kmeans = kmeans.predict(X)
```

Scatter plots 

```python
    ax[i//2,i%2].scatter(X[attrb], X['totalTrucks'])

    ax[i//2,i%2].set(xlabel=attrb,
                     ylabel='totalTrucks', 
                     title=attrb+' vs. totalTrucks')
    x = np.linspace(0,max(X[attrb]),50)
    y = np.linspace(0,1600,50)
    ax[i//2,i%2].plot(x,y, linewidth=3, linestyle="-.", color='red')
```

![image of ML scatter plot](./images/ML.scatterplot.png)

>The scatter plot appears to suggest that when there are lesser numbers of totalTrucks on the road, they are mostly multi trucks. 

>The scatter plot multi vs. totalTrucks has nearly a slope of 1 at lower values. This suggests that the number of totalTrucks is almost as much as the number of multi. As a result, one can infer that there are more multi unit trucks on Ontario roads than there are single unit trucks.

>The auto vs. totalTrucks scatter plot offers better insight. Clearly, there are many more auto than there are other vehicles. At areas of high auto density, it appears traffic of totalTrucks is low. This is because there are more scatter points on the south side of the plot than there are on the north end. 

Again, we see here that overall, there are fewer locations where traffic is dense.This is seen on the scatter plot in the clustering of most points at lower values of auto and totalTrucks.


## Research Questions

Some of the research questions we examined include: 

1. Which station records the highest volume of traffic? What proportion of vehicles makes up the highest traffic volume? 

2. Which highway experiences the highest traffic volume? What proportion of vehicles makes up the highest traffic volume? 

3. What does the daily traffic distribution for each station look like? 

4. On what day of the week is the highest traffic volume registered? 

5. What are the chances of getting stuck in traffic in Toronto downtown when returning from work at 1600hrs in the afternoon? 

6. What is the best time to leave home for work, if working in downtown Toronto? Are there possible favorable alternative routes? 

7. Can we predict the state or nature of traffic on certain highways in the province? 

8. Can we possibly apply clustering to this dataset to see the highway most affected by traffic?
