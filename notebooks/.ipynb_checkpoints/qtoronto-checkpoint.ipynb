    "Ensuring that people and goods are moved safely across Ontario is one of the major objectives of Ontarioâ€™s Ministry of Transportation (MTO). To this end, the ministry often conducts surveys of goods, goods value, passengers and vehicular movement across its five regions around the province.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we examined the survey data provided by the MTO at certain spots in the province of Ontario. According to the metadata, the data provided spans a two-week period in the year 2008. The aim was to derive a few key insights about vehicular movement in the province by extending this small sample to make generalizations about the state of traffic in Ontario. The sample contains over 17000 records and 13 attributes; though it contains only two weeks of data, it seems adequate enough to derive insights about the population from which it was obtained. Some of the questions we examined, in no particular order, include:"

    "Contained in the data is information about traffic stations, highways, MTO regions, week, days and hours of traffic. This notebook takes a modular technique in its analysis of the available data by examining the traffic situation first by stations, then by highways, by MTO regions, directions, vehicle types and by weeks, hours and days of traffic. In cases where it is necessary, combination analysis which jointly examined two or more influences on traffic (traffic highways and vehicle types, or traffic at stations on different highways, for example) was also conducted. Insights derived are delayed in each of the title headings below. \n",
    "\n",
    "At the end, some machine learning techniques were also used to shed light on additional details inherent in the data. Clustering was employed to split the data into areas with different traffic densities across different stations. We used fast fourier transform to carry out some traffic forecasting on the biggest highway in the province. FFT seems fairly suited to predictable data such as this. Finally, we used logistic regression to predict traffic probabilities on some of the highways. The results obtained in most of the analyses conducted appeared consistent, showing repeatedly that certain highways entertained more traffic than others. Some of the curious observations made also include the realization that traffic density or distribution across the province may not have changed a lot since 2008 when this data was released."

These values are the mean probability values, and with an overall accuracy of about 78% provided by the model, we can trust some of the results obtained.

Green colours represent fast traffic, orange medium and red intense traffic. Because it starts at midnight, the gif progresses from green to orange and then red, as traffic increases.

This gif, again taken on a Monday from 0000hrs to 2359hrs, shows the intensity of traffic on the highway, especially south of Keele Street (bright red on map) where station `ON0115` from our data set is located, validating our earlier analysis that this station records the biggest count of vehicle movement in the province. The time lapse shows that traffic is quite high in the morning hours, but is much worse in the afternoon. This is just as we saw in the available dataset. Without doubt, one has the highest chance of getting stuck in traffic at this location. Our probability value of 0.87 seems very reasonable."

    "All of these gifs have been taken from google maps and reflect the current situation of traffic in the province. Our data set, on the other hand, is from 2008. The similarity between our analysis and this most recent data suggests that, at least, the situation of traffic in the province does not seem to have changed very much over time. This is a huge claim and will certainly require that we examine more recent data in other to make sure of this conclusion, else we may get trapped in conclusions with far-reaching consequences which have implications on the province development and possibly the economy. While it is unlikely that the volume of cars has not increased over the years, it is quite possible that the patterns of traffic have not changed, especially if a lot has not changed about the development layout of the province with respect to Toronto."

    "After examining the available data set, we were able to derive some key insights. Some of the biggest traffic in the province happen on `Hwy 401`, `QEW` and `King Edward Ave`. While these may have the highest density of cars and other passenger vehicles, they do not feature among the list of highways which carry truck traffic. These highways, which have the biggest truck traffic, are much closer to the border of the province than they are to the city center. We also found that passenger vehicle traffic consititute the biggest traffic in the province. More passengers move in the province than do goods. While most traffic happen towards the province's financial district of Toronto, other areas outside of Toronto also have traffic which is just as significant, for example `QEW` around Hamilton. However, the highest traffic is towards the east. This could also be because of the location of the city's financial district with respect to all other locations. The northern and southern directions carry the least traffic.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also found something curious about the time plot for highway `Hwy 401`. Though traffic begins to increase at around 5am and peaks at noon, it appears that for the first and last day of the week, the slopes are much gentler than during the other days of the week. Could this suggest some lethargy preventing people from hurrying to work on a Monday and more people relaxing at home on the weekends compared to other busy days of the week? The other denser highway traffic on `QEW` and `King Edward Ave` also follow this trend. Traffic on the last day of the week also did not peter out in the evening as does traffic on other days, possibly suggesting that more people spent longer nights out during the last day of the week?\n",
    "\n",
    "Clustering offers an avenue to cluster the data set into a spectrum ranging from high traffic to minimal traffic based on the size of the traffic for any given hour in a day. This generates an output that could help with labeling the data set and with which further classification could be done if provided with new data set. We went on to predict some future traffic on the biggest highway, `Hwy 401` using `fft`. The easy predicatability of traffic patterns makes `fft` a suitable method for this job, as it can easily duplicate repetitive changes characteristic of traffic. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we used logistic regression to examine the chances of getting stuck on a particular highway. With the generated model we were able to reinforce our earlier conclusion that `Hwy 401` has the biggest vehicle movement and offers the greatest chance of being stuck in traffic. The probability was as high as 80%. We saw also that some other highways, like `Hwy 138`, offer the lowest possibility of traffic. Sample gifs obtained from google maps helped verify our analysis. Comparing our gifs, obtained in 2020, to results from a data set from 2008 shows some eerie similarity which suggests that traffic patterns may not have changed that greatly in the province over the past years."

    "Unfortunately, some of the conclusions derived from this data are limited in reach. This is because the data set only offers a week of data. Besides it is from 2008. Even though the data set is dense enough to derive quality insights, it is still limited in its span. Were it available over several months or years, it would most certainly have enabled better quality insights in its analysis. The data set also does not provide information on construction activities that may have been ongoing while the stations collected traffic information. In the absence of this, we are left to speculate on the cause of certain traffic patterns present in the data set. All of our traffic causes have been attributed to high vehicle density. It is only natural to suspect that this may not have been the case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the non-availability of GPS coordinates in the original data set greatly limited what could be achieved in terms of analysis. A good recommendation would be to include this in subsequent provisions of future data set of this kind. GPS coordinates for traffic data are some of the most indispensable attributes which offer better analysis potential."
